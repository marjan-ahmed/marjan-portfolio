# 🚀 Sanity CMS Integration - Quick Start

## ✅ What's Been Set Up

Your portfolio now has **Sanity CMS** fully integrated! Here's what's ready:

### 📦 Installed & Configured
- ✅ Sanity packages (sanity, next-sanity, @sanity/image-url)
- ✅ 5 Content schemas (Projects, Skills, Experience, Education, Testimonials)
- ✅ Sanity Studio route at `/studio`
- ✅ TypeScript types for type safety
- ✅ Helper functions for easy data fetching
- ✅ Environment configuration templates

## 🎯 Next Steps (Do This Now!)

### 1️⃣ Create Sanity Account (2 minutes)
```
1. Visit: https://www.sanity.io/
2. Sign up (free)
3. Create new project: "Marjan Portfolio"
4. Use dataset: "production"
```

### 2️⃣ Get Credentials (1 minute)
```
1. Go to: https://www.sanity.io/manage
2. Copy your Project ID
3. Go to API → Create token (Editor permissions)
```

### 3️⃣ Set Environment Variables (1 minute)
Create `.env.local` file in project root:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION=2024-01-01

```

### 4️⃣ Start Development Server
```bash

```

### 5️⃣ Access Sanity Studio & Import Data

**Option A: Automated Import (Recommended - Saves 1 hour!)**
```bash
# Install tsx for running TypeScript scripts
npm install -D tsx

# Run the automated import

```

This will automatically import ALL your data (32 items + images) in ~3 minutes! 🚀

Then verify:
```bash
npm run verify
```

**Option B: Manual Entry**
1. Open browser: **http://localhost:3000/studio**
2. Use MIGRATION_REFERENCE.md to copy-paste data

### 6️⃣ Verify Your Data
Open Studio to see imported content:
```
http://localhost:3000/studio
```

You should see:
- 12 Projects
- 12 Skills  
- 3 Experience items
